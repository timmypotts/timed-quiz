Found that I could just have blank divs that I populate using JavaScript, but I had already built the entire page around just deleting and repopulating in certain divs. Will be good to know next time.

I don't have the highscores page functioning yet, but I figured I could just store the scores in local storage and using a sorting algorithm to organize an array of the scores. Then just populate the page in order of scores as text elements.
